I would reach out to the student and follow the steps below:
1- Sincerely apologize (I need to ensure that I do not challenge their complaint)
2 - Try to explain the rationale behind my review - without looking like someone trying to prove that the student is wrong
3 - Offer to assist further (if offer accepted, I would use a different approach but delivering the same review)
4 - Apologize once again (
5 - I would also publicly apologize student on the social media platform on which they made
    the complaint.
