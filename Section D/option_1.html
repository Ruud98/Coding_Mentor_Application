        Suposse my work day is 9 hours long. This is what I would do to ensure that all students
        are assisted, I would devide my day in the following way:

        5 behind - 4 hours 50 minutes (54 minutes each)   50% of my day so that they may catch up
        10 at risk - 3 hours 6 minutes (20+/- minutes each) 40% of my day until they complete their tasks
        5 ahead - 54 minutes (+/- 10 minutes each) 10% of my day so that they are not negatively impacted

        Since the students are on a part time bootcamp, I believe not all of them will be attending
        class everyday, nevertheless, I would still ensure that I dedicate my time according to
        the plan above. More time will be spent assisting the students that are behind. I'd prioritise those that are 
        behind at the same time ensuring that those that are ahead are not affected negatively.
