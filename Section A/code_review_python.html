Positive Aspects
Hi student, thanks for the submission!
Overall, this was a great submission. We only need to address a few aspects of your
work before it is marked complete.

Thank you for using blank horizontal spaces to separate logical sections of your code. This has made
your code to be more readable.


------|| Aspects that could be improved  ||----------
I got an indentation error when I attempted to run your code. To fix this error, please note that
the code from line 5 through line 14 needs to be in the scope/body of your "groupAnagrams" function,
hence you need to indent it once.

You also need to further indent the code from line 10 through line 13 so that it is in the body of your
for-loop.

On line 9 - Kindly note that the sorted() function needs at least one argument, so in this case you need it to
provide the variable (i) as the argument (remember 'i' is representing each and every word in the list that
we are looping through).

General:
Please do not use single-character variable names (even in loops), these are
not descriptive hence they reduce code readability.

Kindly note that we should always comment on our code. Comments are essential because they make it
easy for the next person reading your code to understand what the code does. In short, comments increase
the readability and maintainability of our code.
