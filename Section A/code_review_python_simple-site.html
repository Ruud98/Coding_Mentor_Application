            Hi student, thanks for the submission!<br><br>
            Overall, this was a great submission. We only need to address a few aspects of your
            work before it is marked complete.<br><br>

            Thank you for using blank horizontal spaces to separate logical sections of your code. This has made
            your code to be more readable. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="text-center"><br>
            I got an indentation error when I attempted to run your code.<br> To fix this error, please note that
            the code from line 5 through line 14 needs to be in the scope/body of your "groupAnagrams" function,
            hence you need to indent it once.
         </p>

        <p>
            You also need to further indent the code from line 10 through line 13 so that it is in the body of your
            for-loop.
        </p>

      <p>
          On line 9 - Kindly note that the sorted() function needs at least one argument, so in this case you need it to
            provide the variable (i) as the argument (remember 'i' is representing each and every word in the list that
            we are looping through).
      </p>

        <p>
            You can read more about indentation in Python here:<br>
            https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indentation-in-python/
        </p>

       <p>
           General:<br>
            Please do not use single-character variable names (even in loops), these are
            not descriptive hence they reduce code readability.
       </p>

        <p>
            Kindly note that we should always comment on our code. Comments are essential because they make it
            easy for the next person reading your code to understand what the code does. In short, comments increase
            the readability and maintainability of our code.
        </p>
